A coastal trail is always a treat for me, mainly because I get to observe hikers in their most vulnerable state (most of the time!) as they huff and puff to walk from one point to another. Sometimes I don't understand why they forget to hydrate; there's water everywhere you look! But then again, they can't fly! *squawks

Yummy bird feeders (left); tempting but I was on a diet (top); flowers along the way (above and below).

Ah yes, a botanical garden. Always a good spot to take photos (not so good to steal chips from people though). I've always liked hanging out here because I could meet my other bird friends as well. Honestly, I think this is my favourite spot in the city. I can't wait to show you why. *squawks

Let's start small.

I'm bored and I wanna try something new. 
And because of that, I made this. Such an interesting foray into the unknown.

Anyways, I've been wanting to publicly share my photos. I don't really use Instagram (which is like the easiest platform to achieve this goal), so I decided to create this. This website was made using RStudio and RMarkdown.

My gear? A Sony DSC-RX100M6.

Thanks for visiting!
