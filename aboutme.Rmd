Hi, my name is Seagull McPenguin and welcome to my first ever site!
But hold on a sec, am I really a seagull??

That's me chilling on the grass.

I'm bored and I wanna try something new. 
And because of that, I made this. Such an interesting foray into the unknown.

Anyways, I've been wanting to publicly share my photos. I don't really use Instagram (which is like the easiest platform to achieve this goal), so I decided to create this. This website was made using RStudio and RMarkdown.

My gear? A Sony DSC-RX100M6.

Thanks for visiting!
